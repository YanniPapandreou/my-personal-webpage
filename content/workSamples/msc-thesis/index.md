During my MSc in Statistics at Imperial College I undertook a summer research project under the supervision of [Dr Andrew Duncan](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.duncan). This project involved investigating the use of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for parameter inference in generative models based on ODEs. In particular, an adjoint method for gradient descent in high-dimensional parameter spaces was studied.
